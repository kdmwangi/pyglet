# Pyglet Project Spinoffs

This repo was design to be a starting point for pyglet projects. Each directory within the ``projects/`` directory could be their own repo. Those developers who choose to do this are encouraged to change this file and create a pull request with the change so everyone can enjoy the fun!


## Primary Project Spinoffs

These are projects which started with code in ``pyglet_projects`` and then grew to be __AMAZING!__

* [snake]()
* [asteroids (original)](https://github.com/loktacar/pyglet-asteroids) - the version in `pyglet_projects` is based on this work. There's also a great [tutorial](http://steveasleep.com/pyglettutorial.html)


## Other Pyglet Projects

These projects use pyglet but are not directly related to ``pyglet_projects``. 

* [cocos2d](http://python.cocos2d.org/doc/programming_guide/index.html) - not actually a project it's an additional framework layer for pyglet. 
* [minecraft](https://github.com/boskee/Minecraft) and checkout the [associated talk](http://www.slideshare.net/rdonkin/minecraft-in-500-lines-with-pyglet-pycon-uk)
* [beginners pyglet how to](http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2014/aug/21/python-beginners-pyglet/)
